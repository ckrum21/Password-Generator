# Password-Generater

## Description
The Password Generater is a website that generates a random password based on the criteria entered into the website prompts by the user. The user first must press the "Generate Password" button. Then they must answer a series of questions about their randomly generated password.

 The user must enter how many charaters long they would like their password to be. The password length must be between 8 - 128 characters long. If it does not meet this requirement, then the webpage will alert the user that the password must meet this criteria. If the user eneters any character other than a number, the webpage alerts the user that it has not entered a number. 

 The webpage then asks the user if they would like to use special character, numbers, uppercase, and/or lowercase. Depending how the user answers these questions, the webpage will print the password accordingly.
